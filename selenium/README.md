Selenium Server
================

###Current version number

2.39.0

###Directions

Please ensure you update the version number in this file when you upgrade selenium server. The server
is always updated using the same filename, so we aren't required to update our projects.

i.e.

Selenium Server is usually named:

```
selenium-server-standalone-2.39.0.jar
```

We rename to:

```
selenium-server.jar
```

to ensure that our projects are referencing the most up-to-date version without having to change the filename.
